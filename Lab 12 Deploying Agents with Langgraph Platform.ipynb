      "LangGraph is a framework or tool designed to represent and manage knowledge and information in the form of graphs, often used in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). It typically involves constructing knowledge graphs that capture the relationships between concepts, entities, or pieces of information extracted from text or other data sources.\n",

By structuring linguistic and semantic information into a graph format, LangGraph facilitates more efficient querying and reasoning over complex data.\n",
